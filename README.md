# Fortnite-SDK-Generator

OUTDATED: Use https://github.com/Fischsalat/Dumper-7

I'm well aware that my code isn't really clean or consistent across files and that I may not be using the best ways for certain things, but instead of calling it shit or something I'd appreciate if you'd rather give me constructive feedback on the problem and how to do it better.

Currently supported:
1.2 (needs some fixes)


Oh yea, btw. obviously based on KN4CK3Rs UnrealEngine-SDK-Generator.


Yea well, semi-discontinued. I'm lazy and bored of this project.
