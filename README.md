# Fortnite-SDK-Generator

I'm well aware that my code isn't really clean or consistent across files and that I may not be using the best ways for certain things, but instead of calling it shit or something I'd appreciate if you'd rather give me constructive feedback on the problem and how to do it better.

Currently supported (but not yet working):
1.2

I'm trying to get it to a usable state withing the next few weeks.


Oh yea, btw. obviously based on KN4CK3Rs UnrealEngine-SDK-Generator.
